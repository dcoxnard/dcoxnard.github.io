I'm Dave Oxnard, a recent graduate at the time of writing from the Metis Data Science program in New York City.  I'm interested in the applications of programming and statistical learning, and an avid follower of all things Data Science.  I'm writing this blog to make my Data Science projects accessible to everyone, and as a tool to help me improve my skills.
